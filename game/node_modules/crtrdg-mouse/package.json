  "readme": "# crtrdg mouse\n> mouse listener module for crtrdg\n\n## Goals for crtrdg mouse:\n- Emit click, mouseup, mousedown, and mousemove events.\n\n## Requirements\n- node.js\n- browserify / beefy\n- crtrdg-gameloop (or another game object with a reference to the canvas id)\n\n## Getting started\nInstall node if you haven't already.\n\n### Install browserify and beefy:\n```\nnpm install -g browserify beefy\n```\n\n### Create an index.html file:\n```\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <title>crtrdg gameloop test</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n\n<canvas id=\"game\"></canvas>\n\n<script src=\"./bundle.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Create a game.js file:\n```javascript\n// use crtrdg-gameloop for animating to the canvas with requestAnimationFrame.\nvar Game = require('gameloop');\n\n// require crtrdg-mouse\nvar Mouse = require('crtrdg-mouse');\n\n// create a new game\nvar canvas = document.createElement('canvas');\ndocument.body.appendChild(canvas);\n\nvar game = new Game({\n  renderer: canvas.getContext('2d')\n});\n\ngame.width = canvas.width = 800;\ngame.height = canvas.height = 400;\n\n// create the mouse and pass in the game and canvas element as arguments\nvar mouse = new Mouse(game, canvas);\n\n// listen for click events\nmouse.on('click', function(loc){\n  console.log('click at: ', loc);\n});\n\n// listen for mousedown events\nmouse.on('mousedown', function(loc){\n  console.log('mousedown at: ', loc);\n});\n\n// listen for mouseup events\nmouse.on('mouseup', function(loc){\n  console.log('mouseup at: ', loc);\n});\n\n// listen for mousemove events\nmouse.on('mousemove', function(loc){\n  console.log('mousemove at: ', loc);\n});\n\n// request mouse location directly\ngame.on('update', function (interval) {\n  // mouse location is initialised with {x: 0, y: 0}\n  // and gets updated for every mouse move\n  if(mouse.location.x > this.width) {\n    console.log('where are you going?');\n  }\n});\n```\n\n## Purpose of `crtrdg`:\nAlmost every javascript game / animation library I've found bundles things like requestAnimationFrame polyfill, gameloop, entities, abstract drawing methods, keyboard/mouse input, vector math, and more into one entangled library. If I don't like how the library handles just one of those components, I'm stuck with dead library weight, and sometimes it's difficult to replace a library's methods.\n\nSo what if each element of 2d games were broken up into it's own modules / repositories?\n\nWith inspiration from voxel.js, crtrdg is a collection of javascript modules used for developing 2d games.\n\nAs I learned more about node.js, the core events module, and browserify, I realized the ideal api for making simple 2d games could be based on node's events module. So you'll see a lot of crtrdg modules exposing an api that includes `.on('some event', function(){})`, which seems to make a lot of sense for games.\n\n## Other `crtrdg` modules:\n- [crtrdg-gameloop](http://github.com/sethvincent/crtrdg-gameloop)\n- [crtrdg-keyboard](http://github.com/sethvincent/crtrdg-keyboard)\n- [crtrdg-entity](http://github.com/sethvincent/crtrdg-entity)\n\n\n## Contributing\n- Fork this repository.\n- Create a branch for you changes.\n- Include tests if applicable.\n- Add/edit documentation for any changes.\n- Submit a pull request.\n\n## License\nMIT\n",
